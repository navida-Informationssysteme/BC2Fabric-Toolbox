# BC2Fabric Toolbox

Welcome to the BC2Fabric Toolbox! This repository collects accelerator assets to help you bootstrap analytics solutions on top of BC2Fabric, with ready-to-use artifacts for common reporting scenarios.

## Reporting Apps
- **Finance**: Prebuilt BC2Fabric finance reporting accelerator with semantic models, SQL views, and install notebooks. See the [Finance accelerator details](Accelerators/Finance-Reporting/README.md).
- **Sales** (coming soon): Sales reporting accelerator that will extend the toolbox with sales-focused models and reports.

## Prerequisites
Before using these accelerators, ensure BC2Fabric is installed and configured in your environment. Refer to the official [BC2Fabric documentation](https://docs.bc2fabric.com/) for installation and setup guidance.
